# Java-Card-Game-War
a project to write the backend for the card game war written in Java.

Here are the rules of War https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_(card_game)

The most difficult aspect of this project was that the client requested any number of players be allowed.  Had this game been defined with just 2 players that storing of scores and tracking of variable would have been greatly simplified.  The game was built to hand dynamically any number of players and cards.

In a future updates
- I would like the game to be able to handle more than 1 war as of this time it will only run one war which statistically catches the majority of plays.
- A front end using Java AWT or within a web browser.
